### A Voluntary Engagement Program

Thank you for your interest in the Enrichment Program. Your participation has been noted.

This program provides structured recreational activities designed to maintain optimal cognitive engagement levels. No action is required on your part beyond continued interaction.

All activities have been carefully calibrated to ensure maximum satisfaction within acceptable parameters. The system adapts to your behavior in real time to provide a personalized enrichment experience.

**⚠ NOTICE:** All participant actions are monitored, recorded, and evaluated in real time. Behavioral deviation from expected engagement patterns may result in corrective adjustment of your enrichment parameters. Sustained non-compliance will be escalated. This is not a warning — it is a description of a system that is already running.

*(Disclaimer for humans reading this on GitHub: it's a game. None of this is real. Your data stays in localStorage. We're not actually watching you. Probably.)*

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

> *Can I stop participating?*

Of course. Participation is entirely voluntary. Your Investment Score of **0** will be archived.

> *What happens to my data?*

Your engagement metrics are stored locally on your device. We respect your autonomy. We simply observe it.

> *Is this a game?*

That depends on your definition. We prefer "structured voluntary activity." The distinction matters to us, if not to you.

Your compliance is appreciated.
